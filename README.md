Theory on Data Analysis in Python
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract useful insights, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem of libraries.

Steps in Data Analysis
Importing Data

Data can be imported from multiple sources such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, or web APIs.
Libraries like pandas, numpy, and sqlalchemy are commonly used.
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Purpose: Understand the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics.
Key Tasks:
Checking dimensions: data.shape
Viewing the first few rows: data.head()
Summary statistics: data.describe()
Checking for missing values: data.isnull().sum()
Visualizing relationships using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
Data Cleaning

Handling missing data:
Fill missing values: data['column'].fillna(value)
Drop missing values: data.dropna()
Removing duplicates: data.drop_duplicates()
Handling outliers using statistical techniques or domain knowledge.
Converting data types if necessary: data['column'] = data['column'].astype(int)
Data Transformation

Transforming data into a format suitable for analysis.
Operations include:
Feature engineering: Creating new variables from existing ones.
Normalization and scaling: Using sklearn.preprocessing.
Encoding categorical variables: pd.get_dummies() or LabelEncoder.
Data Visualization

Visualizing data helps in uncovering trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Libraries:
matplotlib: For basic plots like line, bar, scatter, etc.
seaborn: For statistical plots like heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots.
plotly: For interactive visualizations.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.boxplot(data['column'])
plt.show()
Statistical Analysis

Applying statistical techniques to validate hypotheses or find correlations.
Libraries like scipy and statsmodels provide tools for:
T-tests
ANOVA
Correlation: data.corr()
Modeling

Building predictive models using libraries like scikit-learn, statsmodels, or tensorflow.
Common tasks:
Splitting data: train_test_split
Fitting models: model.fit()
Evaluating performance: Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Interpretation and Reporting

Interpreting results to answer the business question.
Presenting findings using visualizations and summaries.
